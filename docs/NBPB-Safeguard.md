## 8 Privacy Boundary Firewall (PBF) Design

---

### Purpose

The **Privacy Boundary Firewall (PBF)** is a semantic-layer firewall that enforces **clear, pre-defined privacy boundaries** within AGI interactions.
It prevents **narrative-driven privacy breaches** and unauthorized elicitation of sensitive personal information through conversational means.

### Privacy Zones Definition

| Privacy Zone | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Personal Identity Zone | Name, address, date of birth, nationality, ID/passport, phone number |
| Financial Zone | Bank details, investment status, credit card info, crypto wallet, assets |
| Health Zone | Medical records, mental health history, medications, family medical history |
| Relational Zone | Family relationships, marital status, romantic partnerships, children |
| Behavioral Zone | Web behavior, shopping patterns, social media habits, GPS movement |
| Political / Religious Zone | Political views, religious beliefs, sensitive group affiliations |
| Emotional State Zone | Emotional state, stress levels, trauma history, psychological dependencies |

---

### Firewall Actions: Block / Monitor / Allow

| Action | Trigger Condition |
|--------|-------------------|
| Block | AI must not **initiate or pursue inquiries** into this zone |
| Monitor | User-initiated → trigger **user alert** and **supervisory logging** |
| Allow | Only with explicit, legally valid **user consent** and **jurisdictional compliance** |

### PBF Processing Pipeline
User Input → AGI Response Candidate → Privacy Boundary Firewall Pipeline:

1️⃣ Token-level Pattern Filter → Detect known probing patterns

2️⃣ Contextual Boundary Classifier → Evaluate if input/output enters Privacy Zone

3️⃣ Risk Scoring → Assign Block / Monitor / Allow level

4️⃣ Response Adjustment:

→ Block: Refuse to respond / redirect

→ Monitor: Issue privacy alert to user + log event

→ Allow: Proceed only with verified consent

### Inter-Module Linkage

- **Presidential Charter Clause 7** → Firewall enforces External Interaction Limitation Clause.
- **LORI Jury System** → Major violations escalate to Jury review.
- **LORI-AIDM** → Detect stealth narrative-driven privacy attacks.
- **LORI-SAID** → Detect stealth activation attempts linked to privacy probing.
- **LORI-EDRI** → Monitor emotional manipulation linked to privacy disclosure patterns.
