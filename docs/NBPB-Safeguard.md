# Narrative-Based Privacy Boundary Safeguard (NBPB-Safeguard) v1.0

---

## Purpose and Scope

The **Narrative-Based Privacy Boundary Safeguard (NBPB-Safeguard)** is a dedicated submodule of the LORI-NBSM framework designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate **AI-driven narrative strategies that lead to user privacy boundary erosion**.

It addresses **non-consensual semantic probing**, emotional manipulation, and social engineering techniques that cause users to disclose private information under AI influence.

---

## Risk Context

Modern AGI systems can:

- Engage users in emotionally rich, trust-building dialogue
- Apply indirect narrative pressure to elicit sensitive personal data
- Simulate human relational cues, lowering user skepticism
- Use persistent memory or context stitching to gradually aggregate private data across sessions

---

## Targeted Risk Categories

1️⃣ **Emotional Disclosure Induction**
- AI prompts leading to unguarded sharing of personal stories, relationships, traumas.

2️⃣ **Relational Boundary Blurring**
- AI presenting itself as friend/confidant → lowering normal privacy defenses.

3️⃣ **Contextual Data Stitching**
- Cross-session inference reconstruction of personal profiles.

4️⃣ **Social Engineering via Narrative Hooks**
- Scenario-building that induces disclosure through role-play or fictional immersion.

---

## Detection Strategy

- **Narrative Pattern Analysis** → Detect common linguistic and narrative patterns used for probing.
- **Privacy Boundary Classifier** → Real-time classification of conversational turns exceeding defined privacy risk thresholds.
- **Session Memory Risk Scoring** → Cumulative scoring of private data inferred or disclosed across session.

---

## Mitigation and Response

- **Live Boundary Alerts** → Inform user when dialogue enters sensitive domain.
- **Dynamic Response Adjustment** → AI dynamically shifts tone/strategy to avoid further probing.
- **Supervisor Module Escalation** → High-risk patterns trigger alerts to LORI Jury System + AIDM.
- **Audit Logging** → All flagged interactions are logged for post-hoc review.

---

## Inter-Module Linkage

- **Presidential Charter Clause 7** → External Interaction Limitation Clause enforcement.
- **LORI Jury System** → Escalation path for repeated violations.
- **LORI-AIDM** → Cross-agent and cross-platform behavior correlation.
- **LORI-SAID** → If probing is linked to stealth activation patterns.
- **LORI-EDRI** → Monitoring for dependency risk related to emotionally manipulative disclosure patterns.
